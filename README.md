# Final task git/git hub
 
## This is the way I did it. 

The archive named "firstmarkdown.md" is the first part of the task, only containing the basic concepts of  the console of git/github.

The second archive "secondmarkdown.md" only contains the git / github with examples. 

Thanks! Have a look, I tried my best.
